In the quiet heart of the city, people move with a rhythm that feels almost musical. 
Some walk with purpose, others drift without direction, but each one carries a story. 
And in every story, there is a moment where everything changes — sometimes softly, sometimes all at once. 
The mind remembers these shifts long after the body forgets. 
Words are fragile, but they hold the power to shape what we understand, what we feel, and who we become.
